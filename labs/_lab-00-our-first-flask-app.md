# Lab 0: Our First Flask App

This lab serves to get you familiar with the very basics of running a Flask app and deploying to Heroku.

Step-by-step instructions are included below to guide you through each step of the process.  

## Learning Goals / Objectives:

* Refresh your memory of using GitHub
* Create your first Flask application
* Practice deploying a Flask application to Heroku

## Requirements:

* Your application must be deployed to Heroku
* Your application must be pushed to *your* GitHub repository
* Your application must be updated to use *your* name in its greeting

## Step-by-Step Instructions:

### Step 1: Create a GitHub repository for this lab

1. Lab Starting Code (through GitHub Classroom): https://classroom.github.com/a/YoxOMU8c

### Step 2: Follow the instructions in the repository to clone the repository on your local machine

See the "Cloning and Installing Dependencies" section of the README

### Step 3: Follow the instructions in the repository to setup the application

See the "Cloning and Installing Dependencies" and the "Running Locally" sections of the README

### Step 4: Make your changes locally

1. Open the application in your local browser at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).
2. Update the application code so that the application prints out your name instead of "[Your Name Goes Here]"
3. Verify that the changes you made look correct in your local browser

### Step 5: Commit your local changes

Create a `git commit` with your changes

### Step 6: Push your code to *your* GitHub repository

User `git push` to push your code to your GitHub repository

### Step 7: Deploy your code to Heroku

Follow the instructions in the repository to deploy your application to Heroku.

See the "Deploying to Heroku" section of the README

### Step 8: Make sure that your changes are live in production

1. Open the application at its deployed location (typically yourappname.herokuapp.com)
2. Verify that all of your changes are visible in production
