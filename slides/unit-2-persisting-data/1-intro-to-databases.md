# Everyone:

1. What you're most excited about doing over break
2. A web topic you're excited about

**Break**: Making $$, friend time, snow!, home, Meowwolf, not being at school, family, warmer weather, find something fun to do in TH

**Topics for my experts**: How to prepare yourself to look promising to a potential employer?, How do you decide what to put in a framework? How to build up a framework?, React x 3 (or Angular), integrating web apps with database x 3, optimizing front ends for accessibility and scale (as in many pages), whatever Eliza thinks, professional tools (instead of picking at random), more advanced features of frameworks like React, front-end common practices, full stack (fe+be), back-end dev, Rust tools, scaling Kubernetes/Docker/etc, other frameworks! (has used tailwind, looking at React), "serverless", lightweight backend for simple embedded microcontrollers, portfolio, more advanced frameworks, CD, cool web apis they've worked on or done, web graphics

Notes to Eliza:
* Mozilla foundation
* Lindsey
* Rick
* Someone that hates on GraphQL (ex-GitHub?)
* T&N FE from Michigan

### Intro to Databases

The majority of students have already taken databases, so I largely skipped this in Fall 2021.

A quick "5 minute primer" to relational databases that I recommended if you haven't yet taken databases: [An Introduction to Relational Databases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kbsG8zsLM).

I also suggested the article [Database Normalization - in Easy to Understand English](https://www.essentialsql.com/database-normalization/) as a resource for becoming familiar with normalization.

## Upcoming Labs

We're not doing Lab 3 today, but a preview of the material is relevant to your preparation.

* Lab 3: Classic Simple todo app with no auth
  * Practice basic ORM skills by implementing CRUD operations
  * Learn more TDD skills by using tests to guide your implementation
    * The tests will be numbered to guide you through a possible route for implementation
