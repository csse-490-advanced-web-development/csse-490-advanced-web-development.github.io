# CSSE-490: Advanced Web Development
### Week 2: Databases as they pertain to Web Applications

The majority of students have already taken databases, so I largely skipped this in Fall 2021.

A quick "5 minute primer" to relational databases that I recommended to the only student that hadn't yet taken databases: [An Introduction to Relational Databases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kbsG8zsLM).

I also suggested the article [Database Normalization - in Easy to Understand English](https://www.essentialsql.com/database-normalization/) as a resource for becoming familiar with normalization.
