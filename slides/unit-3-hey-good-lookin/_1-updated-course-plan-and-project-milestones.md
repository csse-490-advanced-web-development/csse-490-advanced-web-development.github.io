## Lab 2 Recap

* What sucked?
* What was good?
* What is still utterly confusing?

#### Eliza's Key Takeaways:
<br>

* I think that I many need to schedule formal office hours outside of class, so you have an easier time getting help from me.


<br>

#### TODOs:

<br>

* Elaborate on the HTTP methods
* Environment variables
* Address: custom validation and message displaying using wtforms. I got it working, but didn't look super pretty or operate in the manner that I expected
* Address lack of test randomness
* Code reviews / Show lab solution to see better practices

## Project Milestones, as originally outlined on Day 1


We will develop this project in a series of milestones and sprints.  We will start project ideation in Week 0, but we won't start actual coding until midway through the term.  Weeks 8-10 will be lighter on class materials, with labs that are either smaller or entirely optional, so you will have time to focus on developing your project.

* M1: Ideation
* M2: Settling on an idea and a team (optional, up to 2 students)
* M3 (likely splitting this into multiple milestones): Plan your application
    * How will users interact with your application?  (Basic wireframes are required, high fidelity mocks are NOT required)
    * What APIs will you need?
    * How will you structure your application?
    * How will you store and structure your data?
* M4 - MN-1: Weekly sprints with progress reports
* MN: Live presentations during our finals timeslot
