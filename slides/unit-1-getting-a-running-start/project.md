## The Project

The #1 project requirement:  Make something damn cool!

The sky is the limit for project ideas. However, I will be helping you limit the initial scope of your projects to ensure that you are able to create something cool in the time allotted.

## Project Cadence

We will develop this project in a series of milestones and sprints.  We will start project ideation in Week 0, but we won't start actual coding until midway through the term.  Weeks 8-10 will be lighter on class materials, with labs that are either smaller or entirely optional, so you will have time to focus on developing your project.

* M1: Ideation
* M2: Settling on an idea and a team (optional, up to 2 students)
* M3 (likely splitting this into multiple milestones): Plan your application
    * How will users interact with your application?  (Basic wireframes are required, high fidelity mocks are NOT required)
    * What APIs will you need?
    * How will you structure your application?
    * How will you store and structure your data?
* M4 - MN-1: Weekly sprints with progress reports
* MN: Live presentations during our finals timeslot

## Project Requirements

* **#1 project requirement: Must be something you (or someone you care about) deems genuinely cool and useful**
  * Great: An app that combines the APIs for Spotify, a song lyrics service, and a sentiment analysis service to provide sentiment analysis of Spotify playlists or Spotify playlist history
  * Good: A service that emails daily to ask how your day went, then emails you a once-weekly summary, perhaps using sentiment analysis and timestamps to reveal insights about your week
  * Good: A pictographic cookbook for my little sister that can't read yet
  * Bad: A simple CRUD app to track the movies I've watched
* **Must be a web application**
  * (this does not imply the requirement for a front-end-  see the example above about a service that interacts with the user solely via. email)
* **Must be accessible on the public internet**
* **Can be written in any combination of web technologies you wish**
  * It does NOT have to use Flask or React.  We are using these tools in class to learn concepts, not to prescribe technological solutions

## Project Brainstorming

### Let's come up with at least 10 good ideas before we move on.  In all likelihood, we'll end up working on project brainstorming on Friday, as well.

1. Improving on something that already exists
    1. Sharing data between devices (portal)
    1. Scheduling application (hybrid kanban/todo, with ics sync(?))
2. Cloning something you like
    1. Internet enabled coffee maker
3. Filling in a gap that is missing for a hobby/passion
    1. An App For Tracking Presser Feet for Sewing / Presser Foot Encyclopedia
    2. Interactive map of campus, with your schedule highlighted
    3. Custom RPG character sheet application
