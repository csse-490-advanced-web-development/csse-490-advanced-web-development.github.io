# Milestone 6: Project Setup

The deliverable for Milestone 6 is a deployed application in your technology stack of choice.

## Requirements:

* Create your repository using [this GitHub Classroom link](https://classroom.github.com/a/8cGR409z) so that I can easily check in on your progress
  * Note: You will be admins on the repos so you can make them public, move them, etc after this quarter
  * Already have repo(s) elsewhere?  <br>Link to them from the README for this repo, and make sure that I have access to the repo(s)
* Initialize your project:
  1. Generate the starting code for your project in your framework of choice
  2. Add a `.gitignore` file specific to the framework of your choice
  3. Update the README.md file to include all of the sections noted in the template repo
  4. Add __just enough__ code to your project to be able to deploy it and have a "Hello World" message appear
* Deploy the project
